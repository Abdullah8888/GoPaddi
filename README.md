# ``GoPaddi``

An intuitive flight booking app that lets you search, view all planned 
trips, and book flights seamlessly.


## How to run the project

Open the project via xcode after cloning it. 

Note: If you encounter an 'Unknown error,' it means you need to change the baseUrl.


### Steps to Change the Base URL
- Visit https://beeceptor.com/crud-api/  to generate a new base Url for api/trip, make sure it ends with api/trip.
- Open Constant.swift in the project and replace the old baseUrl with the new one.

- Run the project again. You should no longer see any errors, and you should be able to create a trip that will automatically reflect on the Trip landing page.
